# 📊 Data Analytics Portfolio – Domenico Monteleone

Welcome to my data analytics portfolio.  
This space collects real-world and course-based projects focused on generating **business insights**, improving **operational efficiency**, and supporting **strategic decision-making** through data.

With a background in **Supply Chain Management**, I apply tools like **R**, **Python**, **Tableau**, and **Power BI** to analyze demand, optimize processes, and turn data into action.

🛠️ **End-to-end workflows** using R, Python, SQL, Tableau  
📈 **Key use cases**: Demand forecasting · Inventory control · Customer service optimization · Process automation

All projects follow a structured, problem-solving approach — often based on frameworks like the Google 6-Phase Analysis (Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, Act).
